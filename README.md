# kb-solitaire

kb-solitaire is a solitaire game that runs in your terminal.

## Controls

Card areas can be interacted with by pressing the key indicated above them. Press **E** to deselect. **Q** is used to flip a new card onto the discard pile, or move the discard pile back to the draw pile if the draw pile is empty. In the tableau, press the indicated key to select the bottom card. Pressing the key again extends the selection to the bottom 2 cards (if a second card is selectable). Once the selection reaches the top, pressing the key again wraps the selection size back to 1. Holding **SHIFT** while pressing a tableau key cycles the selection size in reverse; it starts with the largest possible selection and then shrinks it. A sequence of **SHIFT**ed and non&hyphen;**SHIFT**ed key presses will move the selection size back and forth; these two control styles can be combined to quickly correct overshoots.
